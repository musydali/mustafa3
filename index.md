# Welcome To My Humble Abode!

A little about me? I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I am pursuing a Bachelor's in the Fine Arts for Industrial Design, while attempting to pursue a minor in Computer Science.


## Experience? What's That?

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/musydali/mustafa3/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
