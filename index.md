# Welcome To My Humble Abode!

A little about me? I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I am pursuing a Bachelor's in the Fine Arts for Industrial Design, while attempting to pursue a minor in Computer Science.


## Experience? What's That?

A designer without any type of portfolio is like a banana without its peel. It's still a banana, but you wouldn't really want to have anything to do with said banana.

Below you will find links to two of my "enough to get by portfolio".
