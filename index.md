# Welcome To My Humble Abode!

A little about me? I am currently a freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I am pursuing a Bachelor's in the Fine Arts for Industrial Design, while attempting to pursue a minor in Computer Science.

## Experience? What's That?

A designer without any type of portfolio is like a banana without its peel. It's still a banana, but you wouldn't really want to have anything to do with said banana.

Below you will find links to two of my "enough to get by portfolio". 

1. [Design Projects](https://mustafa327.wixsite.com/mustafa)

2. [Google Drive Folder With More of My Work](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7g8lYB6JbLdNXdsZ1RTSW9Objg?usp=sharing)

Within the design realm, I have extensive experience with Adobe After Effects, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Premiere, and Autodesk Maya. When I'm not working on making videos or working with special effects, you can catch me working with 3D Models and 3D Animations. 

Here is a YouTube Channel with two animations that I have worked on: [AMAX Studios](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7g8lYB6JbLdNXdsZ1RTSW9Objg?usp=sharing)

### Professional Experience 

There's really only three things that I would like to highlight under this specific category.

1. China Cargo Airlines
* Over the summer, I worked at O'Hare International Airport as the Load Planner for China Cargo Airlines.
* It was my responsibility to make sure that the weight checks out and that the airplane would safely take-off and land after taking account it's zero-fuel weight, take-off weight, and the weight of all the cargo.
* Along with that, it was my responsibility to ensure that there was not too much weight on one side or one end of the plane and avoiding disbalance of the plane.
2. MUS-LIM Magazine
* Currently I am on the team of a new publication on campus.
* I am both on the design team for the publication and leader of the publicity team, helping create fliers, videos, and just spreading out name.
3. Photographer 
* What started off as a hobby in high school has slowly turned into something that is somewhat of a small "business".
* While I do regular hobby photography, I have also started to do event photography both here on campus and back home in the suburbs of Chicago. 

### Computer Science Experiences

It was AP Computer Science during my sophomore year in high school which really sparked my interest. In high school, the main two languages I learned were Java and Lua. Lua is what we used for mobile app development and making games with Corona, which was a software developing kit. 

Through Java I was able to compete in conferences like Business Professionals of America, compete against great minds in the state, come out on top, and then go on to compete against more minds at the national level in various different states.
